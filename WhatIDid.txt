Uninstalled homebrew, nvm, node, npm, nodemon, express
(to disassociate brew and npm--they don't like each other.
I'll reinstall brew for things like python and sql later).

Installed nvm:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash

Installed node (which now includes npm):
nvm install node

Checked everything installed ok:
nvm --version && node -v && npm -v0

Made a git repo for the site and clone it 
    git clone <URL from github>
    cd (to the the new folder)

Created Client Side stuff:
    Got vue.js going (client server will run on localhost:8080):
    npm install -g vue-cli
    vue init webpack <name of new client side folder>
    cd <name of new client side folder>
    npm install
    git add --all
    git commit -m 'got Vue going'
    git push
    npm run dev

Created Server Side stuff:
    cd .. (if still in client side folder)
    mkdir <name of new server side folder>
    cd <name of new server side folder>
    npm init -f
    npm install --save nodemon eslint
    node ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js --init
    (add "no-console":0 to the rules in the new .eslintrc.json file)
    npm start
    (ctrl+c)
    npm install --save express body-parser cors morgan
